## big-data-analytics-project

This project aims to examine a relationship between the dependence of city revenue on fines/tickets and the potential
effect on violent crimes. The idea was inspired by the Ferguson riots of 2014.
Following the riots, several articles pointed to how the city generated approximately 20%
of their municipal revenue from tickets and fines. Many experts argued this reduced the faith
of the local population in the police and overall city government. 
Our objective is to see whether there may be a pattern in other parts of the country.
