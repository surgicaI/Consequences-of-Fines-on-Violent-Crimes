FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics

The FBI collects violent and property crime data from local and county police agencies, going back, in part, to
the 1960s. They provide access to the statistics via their FBI UCR tool, found at https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/.
The data can be exported in a number of formats, including CSV.
I am working on a crawler to generate the tables for 2013 and export them for our processing.
